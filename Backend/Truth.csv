"DA, Marcos ‘do not support’ zero tariff plan on rice imports","The Department of Agriculture (DA) does not agree with the Department of Finance’s (DOF) proposal to reduce tariffs on rice imports down to 0%– and no less than President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who is serving concurrently as the DA chief, shares this stance. 
“The department does not support the 0% tariff. And that is the position of the President,” said Isabela 1st District Representative Tonypet Albano, speaking on behalf of the DA during the House plenary debates on Monday, September 25. 
The zero tariff plan was proposed by the DOF to supposedly help reduce the price of rice. This proposal came after the much-contested executive order of the President which imposed a price cap on regular and well-milled rice affecting many rice retailers nationwide. 
Even the mere lowering of tariffs, as earlier suggested by National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, was thumbed down by the President.
Following a meeting with NEDA on Tuesday, September 26, Marcos said, “We decided with the agriculture and economic managers that…it was not the right time to lower tariff rates because the projection of world rice prices is that it will go down.”
According to the press release from the Presidential Communications Office, Balisacan, along with DA undersecretaries Leocadio Sebastian and Mercedita Sombilla, agreed during the meeting with the President about the inopportuneness of lowering tariffs.
During the House plenary debates, assistant minority leader Arlene Brosas was saying the zero tariff plan will have negative implications on farmers, who already experience delays in getting cash assistance from excess tariff revenues.",News,"September 26, 2023"

House serves expulsion notice to Arnie Teves,"The House of Representatives has served the expulsion notice to former Negros Oriental Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr., House Secretary General Reginald Velasco said Thursday.

Velasco made the announcement a day after the House plenary, via a 265-0-3 vote, moved to expel Teves from its ranks due to disorderly conduct and violation of Code of Conduct amid application for political asylum, continuous absence and posting a video of himself on social media wearing boxer shorts.

“We have just released the letter to Mr. Teves Jr., it was received by his office, informing him, thru his office, about the decision of the plenary to expel him as a member of the House of Representatives,” Velasco said.

“This was served in his office a few minutes ago. This is the implementation of the decision of the plenary,” he added.

Prior to his expulsion, Teves had been suspended for 60 days without pay twice.

“All the staff [members] of the members of [the House of Representatives] are co-terminus with the term of the congressman/woman, so they will have to vacate the office, and the office will be taken over by the caretaker,” Velasco pointed out.

Velasco, however, said the House leadership has yet to decide on who will serve as the caretaker of Teves’ district.

“We are still awaiting the decision of the House leadership on who will be the caretaker of the district of Arnolfo Teves,”  Velasco said.
Teves’ camp had described the decision as “a dark day for the Rule of Law.”
“The proceedings before the House Committee on Ethics and Privileges are nothing but that of a kangaroo court,"" Teves’ lawyer, Ferdinand Topacio, said in a statement on Wednesday.
“From the start of the proceedings, it bore all the hallmarks of an inquisition: the Committee was the motu proprio Complainant, making it both the accuser and the judge; Rep. Teves was never allowed to participate in the proceedings by himself, but only through letters of his counsel, who were never even allowed to present; the hearings, although impressed with public interest, was kept secret, like a medieval Court of the Star Chamber; and the final recommendation shows that there was never a bona fide intention to consider the evidence in favor of Mr. Teves.”",News,"August 17, 2023"

President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has acknowledged Japan’s role in maintaining peace and security in the West Philippine Sea.
Marcos mentioned this during the courtesy call of Komeito Party Chief Representative Yamaguchi Natsuo in Malacañang Palace on Wednesday.

The President said the bilateral and multilateral partnerships and agreements that the Philippines and Japan have entered into have given regard to maintaining stability in the resource-rich region.

“I refer to the tripartite trilateral agreements that we have been talking about and have started to implement in terms of joint patrols, in terms of joint exercises for the two maritime forces of Japan and the Philippines,” Marcos said in a press statement issued Thursday.

“In that regard, we must acknowledge the very important contributions that Japan has made to the Philippines in terms of not only training, not only in terms of equipment, but also in the agreements that we have been able to forge between our two countries in terms of cooperation, in terms of preserving the peace and allowing the free conduct of trade and shipping [in] the South China Sea,” he added.

Chiz Escudero likely to vote vs. mandatory ROTC bill: It won’t inculcate patriotism,"Senator Francis “Chiz” Escudero on Wednesday said he is likely to vote against the mandatory Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) training as he believed it will not inculcate patriotism to students.“I will most likely vote against it. I took a position against it,” Escudero said in an ANC interview.

“I am against this simply because I don’t see the wisdom behind it that ROTC will inculcate patriotism and love for country. I went through CMT, Citizens' Military Training, and I don’t think I got love for country from that,” he explained.

Further, Escudero also challenged the survey commissioned by Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, who favors the passage of the mandatory ROTC bill, saying the result that 78% are in favor of reviving the military training for students must be reflected on the percentage of college students who take the optional ROTC program under the National Service Training Program (NSTP) Law.“Is that a survey using random sampling? I am using actual hard facts and data which is, of those required to take NSTP, only 18% or on a good year for ROTC 20% take the ROTC option, kung 75% ang may gusto n’yan eh di sana 75% ng 18-24 na college students natin ROTC ang kinuha at pwede naman nilang kuhanin sa ilalim ng NSTP law,” he pointed out.

The proponents of the measure should also show a study that NSTP is not a success, Escudero said.

“If NSTP is not a success and ROTC is part of NSTP then I guess ROTC should be deemed as a failure as well and I should be looking at something totally new,” he went on.

Apart from challenging the need to revive the ROTC program, Escudero likewise questioned the curriculum under the proposed law as its proponents would like to include law enforcement, disaster resiliency, community service, nationalism, and patriotism.


“How will this be divided? ’Yung number of units na lang, 'di na kami magkasundo eh. Sabi nila four hours a week daw pero three units. Basic ‘yun di ba? Kung ilang oras sa isang linggo ‘yun ang bilang ng unit, and you are including this in the curriculum?” he said.

“The student cannot graduate unless he completes this. So if this is going to be two years, so you are talking 12 additional units… that a college student would have to pass and accomplish,” he said.

Escudero, who chairs the Senate committee on higher education, said he “inhibited” from tackling the mandatory ROTC bill but he passed it on to a sub-committee headed by Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa so the latter can sponsor and defend it.

“I inhibited myself, I didn’t stifle it…. I won’t archive it, I won’t stifle it because I have zero-backlog in my committees…to be fair and I told him that I will interpellate and most likely vote against it and that is what I am doing now,” he said.

The bill reviving the mandatory ROTC program is currently being debated in the Senate plenary. It is named as one of the priority measures of the Marcos administration.

No less than Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri said he will vote in favor of the proposed law but he said the senators agreed to vote on the measure based on conscience.

The system features the Automated Counting Machine (ACM), which is intended to replace the more than 90,000 vote counting machines (VCM) used in the 2016 and 2019 elections.

Under the approved TOR, FASTrAC will have the following features:-Precinct-based upgraded paper-based AES but with DRE capabilities, which still utilizes a paper ballot.

-Election results shall be sent separately and directly from the ACM to the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas, dominant majority party, dominant minority party, and citizens arm servers.

-The ballot box shall include a separate box for the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail or voter’s receipts

Further, the Comelec en banc approved the reorganization and renaming of the Campaign Finance Office into the Political Finance and Affairs Department (PFAD).

PFAD will be divided into three divisions: the Party Affairs and Registry Division, the Campaign Finance Division, and the Legal Compliance Division.

Laudiangco said this will be the primary office responsible for the enforcement and implementation of all administrative regulations and legislative measures pertaining to electoral parties and campaign finance, as well as serving as the registration office for the proprietary rights of accredited political parties.

PFAD is likewise empowered to initiate complaints against violators of laws pertaining to campaign finance and electoral parties, as well as petitions for perpetual disqualification to hold public office, and to conduct fact-finding inquiries or preliminary  examinations as may be directed by the Comelec. 

It will also have the power to monitor the fundraising and spending activities of candidates and electoral parties, conduct field inspections at the headquarters/offices and open the books and records of electoral parties.

""As Comelec puts a premium on transparency and accountability, PFAD will also ensure that the constitutional right of the people to information on matters of public concern will likewise be strengthened.
